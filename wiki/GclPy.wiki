# "Mommy, I want to use perforce." "Dont be ridiculous, use svn and gcl.py"

= Description =
gcl/gcl.py is a script wrapper, which provides some nice functionality
to svn. At first, it let's you manage changelists, using "gcl change"
and "gcl changes" (Yes, svn supports changelists, but they are not
working really well). Secondly, this tool uses upload.py to upload
your changelist onto review server, where other developers may check
your code. And finally, it allows you to commit the code.
